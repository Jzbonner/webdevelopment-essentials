# C# and ASP.NET - FullStack Development
Performant, Secure, and Maintainable

## Understanding FullStack Development
Why use C#, when fullstack development is possible in languages like
JavaScript, Python, PHP, etc.? Traditionally languages like C# were not used
for web application development. But with the advent of the ASP.NET Core Web
Framework, creating performant and secure web applications is more than
possible with C#. This is a stack that is geared at resource or data intensive web
applications (think enterprise level webapps or large web based projects). 

## ASP.NET Core 
This is actually different from ASP.NET Framework, despite having a very
similar name.
