# Pro MERN Stack: Full Stack Web App Development 
[Pro MERN Stack](https://www.amazon.com/Pro-MERN-Stack-Development-Express/dp/1484243900)
Full stack web application development with mongodb, express, react and node.js. Understanding the client side (front-end), the server side (back-end) and the middleware that connects the two. Developing a full stack application requires a focus on design, app logic and error handling. This book explores how the modern MERN tech stack enables developers to build full functional and reliable software applications. 

## What is MERN Stack?
Any web application is built using multiple technologies and the combination of these technologies is called a stack (example: LAMP - Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP). The MEAN stack was one of the early open-source stacks that sparked a shift towards Single Page Applications and the adoption of NoSQL. Over the years, Angular.js, has brought on the rise of other front-end frameworks such as React.js, Vue.js, etc. The MERN stack was created as a way to primarily utilize the core React library for client-side rendering in place of the MVC architecture that Angular offers. 

## React Components Overview
There are two main ways of coding React Components: **Class-Based Comopnents and Functional Components**. The difference among the two is in how the underlying JSX is rendered. A functional compenent is just a plain JavaScript function that returns JSX. A class component is a JavaScript class tht extends the `React.Component`, which has a render method.
