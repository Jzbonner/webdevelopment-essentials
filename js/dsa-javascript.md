# Data Structures and Algorithms in JavaScript
A data structure is a named location that can be used to store and organize data. An algorithm is a collection of steps to solve a particular problem. Learning data structures and algorithms allow us to write efficient and optimized computer programs.  

## The Fundamental Building Blocks
An overview of the JavaScript programming language and a deeper dive into data structures and algorithms. The goal is to understand important principles about managing and structuring data with data structures and how to manipulate those data structures with core computer science algorithms. Will cover pattern recognition and popular use cases for each data structure/algorithm. Will provide an understanding of time complexity in the scope of computation. 

### Declaring and Initializing Variables
[comment]: # (make a reference to your notes on javascript variables from your blog)

JavaScript variables are global by default. In the scope of data structures and algorithms **(dsa)**, it is best practice to declare your variables with a scope-defining keyword before using them in your code logic. Refer to examples below: 

```javascript
var number; 
let multiple = number * 3; 
const hello = () => {console.log('Hello World')}
```

### Arithmetic and Math Library Functions 
It's helpful to understand that theoretical computer science is based in mathematics. Understanding coding patterns and paradigms should be done so through the lens of math. You don't need high level math ability to code, but you do need to think through logic problems as having mathematical solutions.

### Decision Constructs 

### Understanding Arrays
Arrays are linear and indexed... 


⌛ Time Complexity
Access — O(1): Accessing an element in the list requires addressing it with the index.
Search — O(n): Searching if an element exists in a list requires (in the worst case) to traverse each index on by one
Insert/Delete — O(n): Inserting(Deleting) an element from a list first requires to be found which is O(n)
